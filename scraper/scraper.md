This will mostly be an exploration of the twitter api


We want to:
	find trending hashtags
	gather tweets with these hashtags
	process these tweets
		clean the tweets, remove @s and #s that are not needed/
		gather stats about tweets
	store the tweets in a catalog

To also increase my knowledge of webdev, everything will happen inside a django app
